# hhi                : Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for mine/primary production (0-10000)
# main_producer      : Country with largest production share
# main_producer_share: Main producer share of global supply (%)
# wgi_score          : Normalized World Governance Indicator of main producer (0=worst, 1=best)
